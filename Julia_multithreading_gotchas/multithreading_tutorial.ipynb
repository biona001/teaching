    "This notebook compiles a list of example code to illustrate Julia's [multithreading](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/multi-threading/) feature. We focus on \"performance gotchas\" which are not well-documented (as of 2020). Note multithreading parallelism is different than Julia's [distributed parallelism](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Distributed/) in that the former always assume all data are present on a single computer.
