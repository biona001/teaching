    "# Tools of the Trade\n",
    "\n",
    "The most recommended tools include\n",
    "\n",
    "1. the Julia REPL (terminal),\n",
    "2. [Juno](https://junolab.org/), the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) in [Atom](https://atom.io/),\n",
    "3. [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks with support through the [IJulia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl) project, and\n",
    "4. [Weave](https://github.com/JunoLab/Weave.jl) for scientific reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "You do not have to use each one, and you can always use your favorite plaintext editor (Notepad++, Emacs, vim, ...) with a Julia language support extension.\n",
    "Reports are best handled by Jupyter notebooks and Weave while extended coding should be done in an editor.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Another Option*: [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with Julia language support.\n",

    "### How to Use the Julia REPL\n",
    "\n",
    "A Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) is an interactive programming environment where the program\n",
    "\n",
    "- **reads** input from a user,\n",
    "- **evaluates** the input, and\n",
    "- **prints** the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Julia REPL is a sophisticated calculator used to perform one-off calculations and run scripts interactively.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "**Normal Execution**: Enter an expression and press `Enter` to execute it.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "julia> 1 + 1\n",
    "2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Help System**: Type `?` and enter the name of a function, type, or variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "help?> Float64\n",
    "search: Float64 Float16 Float32 float floatmin floatmax Cfloat BigFloat\n",
    "\n",
    "  Float64(x [, mode::RoundingMode])\n",
    "\n",
    "  Create a Float64 from x. If x is not exactly representable then mode\n",
    "  determines how x is rounded.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Examples\n",
    "  ≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡\n",
    "\n",
    "  julia> Float64(pi, RoundDown)\n",
    "  3.141592653589793\n",
    "\n",
    "  julia> Float64(pi, RoundUp)\n",
    "  3.1415926535897936\n",
    "\n",
    "  See RoundingMode for available rounding modes.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n",
    "\n",
    "  Float64 <: AbstractFloat\n",
    "\n",
    "  64-bit floating point number type.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Package Manager**: Type `]` and enter a command. You can use `?` to get help with package mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "(v1.1) pkg> update\n",
    "  Updating registry at `~/.julia/registries/General`\n",

    "**Note**: It is possible to use the package manager in non-interactive scripts. For example, the following is equivalent to `] status`:"
