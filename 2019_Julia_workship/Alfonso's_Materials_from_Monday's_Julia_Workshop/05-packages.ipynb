    "# Packages You May Find Useful\n",
    "\n",
    "### Base\n",
    "\n",
    "Julia's [Base](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/base/) forms the core of the Julia language. It is mostly written in Julia itself!\n",
    "\n",
    "Important highlights:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Collections](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/collections/)\n",
    "- [Mathematics](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/math/)\n",
    "- [Strings](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/strings/)\n",
    "- [Filesystem](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/file/)\n",
    "- [Input/Output](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/io-network/)\n",
    "- [Profile](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Profile/)\n",
    "- [Sorting](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/sort/)\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Standard Library\n",
    "\n",
    "These packages ship with Julia by default, but are not loaded automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [LinearAlgebra](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/LinearAlgebra/)\n",
    "- [Statistics](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Statistics/)\n",
    "- [Random](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Random/)\n",
    "- [SparseArrays](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/SparseArrays/)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "The [IJulia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl) package is required if you want to make and run Jupyter notebooks locally.\n",
    "JuliaBox users have this by default and *should* never have to worry about it.\n",
    "It is recommended that you follow the default instructions *unless you know what you're doing and are willing to spend time problem-solving*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Working with Data\n",
    "\n",
    "- [DataFrames](https://github.com/JuliaData/DataFrames.jl): Work with data in a similar way as in R.\n",
    "- [DataFramesMeta](https://github.com/JuliaData/DataFramesMeta.jl): Provides macros like `@with` and `@select` for constructing queries. Think `dyplr` from R.\n",
    "- [Query](https://juliadata.github.io/DataFrames.jl/stable/man/querying_frameworks/#Query.jl-1): Same as above, but has a slightly different syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Plotting\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Plots](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Plots.jl): A metapackage for data visualization in Julia.\n",
    "It defines a common interface for multiple *backends* that handle the real work in plotting:\n",
    "  - [PyPlot](https://github.com/JuliaPy/PyPlot.jl): A Julia \"wrapper\" around Python's `matplotlib`. *If it works on your machine*, it's probably the most consistent choice for a backend.\n",
    "  - [GR](https://github.com/jheinen/GR.jl): The default backend, which is excellent. The only problem is that some plot types *may* turn out a bit ugly *when used as a backend for Plots.jl*. It's more consistent when used alone.\n",
    "- [StatsPlots](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/StatsPlots.jl): An extended library of plot types not included in Plots.jl\n",
    "- [RecipesBase](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/RecipesBase.jl): If you design a custom type that needs a visualization, this is the best way to do it.\n",
    "\n",
    "If neither of these backends work for you, there are additional alternatives in the Plots.jl documentation. Otherwise, use RCall.jl or PyCall.jl to do your plotting in a different language.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Profiling\n",
    "\n",
    "- [BenchmarkTools](https://github.com/JuliaCI/BenchmarkTools.jl): Measure running time and memory allocation of your code.\n",
    "- [TimerOutputs](https://github.com/KristofferC/TimerOutputs.jl): Tag specific parts of your code for profiling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other Interesting Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "- [OpenMendel](https://openmendel.github.io/)\n",
    "- [JuliaNLSolve](https://github.com/JuliaNLSolvers/NLsolve.jl)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Cutting-Edge Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "- [DifferentialEquations](https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/DifferentialEquations.jl)\n",
    "- [JuMP](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/JuMP.jl): Mathematical optimization\n",
    "- [ApproxFun](https://github.com/JuliaApproximation/ApproxFun.jl): Numerical analysis\n",
    "- [Flux](https://github.com/FluxML/Flux.jl): Machine learning"
